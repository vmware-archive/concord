# Concord

Project Concord is an open source, scalable decentralized Blockchain. It 
leverages the [Concord-BFT](https://github.com/vmware/concord-bft) engine
based on years of academic and industrial research, and implements 
a Blockchain which supports running Ethereum smart contracts.

To get started:
```bash
# Build the docker image (will take some time)
docker/build_images.sh

# Run a 4-node Concord system and the EtherRPC bridge with docker compose
docker-compose -f docker/compose/simple4.yml up

# Connect to Concord with Truffle (in a different window)
# Or use your own local copy of Truffle and connect to localhost:8545
docker exec -it compose_concord-truffle_1 bash
truffle console --network ethrpc1
```
